One formulation of an Agile way of building software, often missattributed to Kent Beck, is:

> Make it work, make it right, make it fast -- Kent Beck

Where

-   **work** is making the tests pass
-   **right** is refactoring the code
-   **fast** is optimizing the code to make it, for example, run quickly
