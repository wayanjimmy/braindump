Divide this into 4 pillars that should balance each other:

1.  Brain (knowledge, relevance, professional expertise, lifelong learning)
2.  Love (relationships, family, community, care)
3.  Change (openness to self-question, networks, transition skills)
4.  Choice (financial flexibility, savings, earning power)

Come up with your own guiding principle and make your own list of life
pillars. Now ask yourself two things:

1.  Review the balance of the past seven years. What ratio of your time did you invest in each?
2.  What balance would you like for the next seven years?
