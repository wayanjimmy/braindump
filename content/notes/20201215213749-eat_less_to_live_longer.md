## 80% rule {#80-rule}

It's easy to do: When you notice you're almost full but _could_ have a little more ... just **stop** eating!

Serving food on many plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and facilitates the varied diet.


## Eat less to live longer {#eat-less-to-live-longer}

An alternative to following 80% rule on a daily basis is to fast for one or two days each week. The 5:2 (or fasting) diet recommends two days of fasting (consuming fewer than five hundred calories) every week and eating normally on the other five days.
