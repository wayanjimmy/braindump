## In general, there are 2 drawbacks of measurements that focus on productivity {#in-general-there-are-2-drawbacks-of-measurements-that-focus-on-productivity}

1.  Focus on _outputs_ rather than _outcomes_
2.  Focus on individual or local measures rather than team or global ones.

There are some examples:


### Line of code {#line-of-code}

-   Rewarding developers for writing lines of code leads to bloated software that incurs higher maintenance costs and higher cost of change.
-   Minimizing lines of code isn't an ideal measure
-   Accomplishing a task in a single line of code that no one else can understand is less **desirable** than writing a few lines of code that are easily understood and maintained.


### Velocity {#velocity}

-   They inflate their estimates and focus on completing as many stories as possible at the expense of collaboration with other teams (which might decrease their velocity and increase other team's velocity, making them look bad)
