## Prepare your hero {#prepare-your-hero}

1.  Read dota wiki for your hero
2.  Last hit in an empty lobby
3.  Last hit against insane bots
4.  Practice combos
5.  Theory craft what each spell can optimally be used for
6.  Get a feel for how much damage your spells do
7.  Look for guides on the hero
8.  Watch 5 high level replays
9.  Plan a generic build


## Play the Game! {#play-the-game}

1.  Pick your main hero
2.  Do your best
    -   Prioritize the laning stage and early-game
3.  After every game:
    -   Why did the game go the way it did?
    -   Something you learned
    -   Something you need to improve
    -   Something you did well
    -   Can't think of anything, watch the replay
4.  Repeat as long as you feel good about playing
5.  If you don't feel like you can play your best:
    -   Take a break
    -   Go practice
    -   Watch educational content/replays


## Mentality Tips {#mentality-tips}

1.  You suck. Ditch the pride
2.  Do not focus on other players
3.  Only focus on what you can do to improve
4.  Assume any game that isn't on your main role/hero is a loss
5.  Losing is part of the process
6.  If a game looks like a loss:
    -   Just try to learn something
    -   Experiment with something new
    -   Have fun and de-tilt
