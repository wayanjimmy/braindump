## Mindmap {#mindmap}

See the mindmap in [mindomo](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/55ec1b347a924b3d90c6fcd6135d2f2c)


## What? {#what}

Single command, almost no config

Easy to install

Configurable with cloud-init

For prototyping cloud instances locally

```bash
multipass launch -c 2 -d 30G -m 2G --name karunabox
```

ssh ke dalam vm

```bash
multipass shell karunabox
```

mount volume

```bash
multipass mount source karunabox:destination

# mount current directory
multipass mount . karunabox:destination
```


## Why? {#why}

Make your development environment as similar as the production one

Safe place to make mistakes

Isolated development environment

Already familiar with Ubuntu Linux

It's fun :D, at least for me to learn about VM and container


## How? {#how}


### Launch a vm {#launch-a-vm}

Start a vm as easy as

```bash
multipass launch <vm_name>
```

You can also alocate some cpu `-c`, disk `-d` and the memory `-m`

```bash
multipass launch -c 2 -d 30G -m 2G --name devbox "21.04"
```

The commmand above will create a vm with 2 cpu, 30G of storage disk and 2G of memory, name devbox and ubuntu image 21.04


### List all vms {#list-all-vms}

```bash
multipass list
```


### Stop a vm {#stop-a-vm}

```bash
multipass stop devbox
```


### Start a vm {#start-a-vm}

```bash
multipass start devbox
```


### SSH-ing into the vm {#ssh-ing-into-the-vm}

```bash
multipass shell devbox
```

What if you want to use the ordinary `ssh` command tu ssh to the vm?

yes, could use cloud-init for that, I put the step by step [here]({{<relref "20210708204033-ssh_copy_into_multipass_instance_using_cloud_init.md#" >}})


### Share volume between host and vm {#share-volume-between-host-and-vm}

Yes. you can share file easily between host and vm, I use this for example restoring a [MySQL]({{<relref "20210415133341-mysql.md#" >}}) database to a vm

```bash
multipass mount <path_on_host> <vm_name>:<destination_path_inside_vm>
```

Example

```bash
multipass mount . devbox:~/codes
```

The command above will share all files inside current directory on host to the `~/codes` directory inside the devbox vm.


## What next? {#what-next}

Installing some apps such as [MySQL]({{<relref "20210415133341-mysql.md#" >}}), [Elasticsearch]({{<relref "20201221151118-elasticsearch.md#" >}}), [Docker]({{<relref "20210518095808-docker.md#" >}}), could be take a lot of time if you do it over and over again with several vms, so [Ansible]({{<relref "20210807084603-ansible.md#" >}}) come to the rescue, this is an example of my [personal ansible playbook](https://gitlab.com/jimboylabs/homelab/-/tree/main/ansible), and will add more later.
