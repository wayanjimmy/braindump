If your project has multiple binaries, it's a good idea to have a ~cmd/~ subdirectory to hold them.

If your project is large and has significant of non-Go code, like UI assets or sophisticated build tooling, it might be a good idea to keep your Go code isolated in ~pkg/~ subdirectory.

If you're going to have multiple packages, it's probably a good idea to orient them around the business domain, rather than around accidents of implementation.

That is: package user, yes; package models, no.
